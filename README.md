# Spotify Clone

I built this app to keep my React Native skills sharp, while also relearning some TypeScript and more about AWS Amplify. There are a few Type errors in the project as it stands,
but nothing that crashes it. I built this app with resources from notJustDev from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmynMyn8o6E&list=PLY3ncAV1dSVBejIDGrcbNRs148uHowYfx&index=3

I've only tested this project on Android Studio, so there may be issues on iOS, but if you'd like to run this project, simply clone the repo and run the "npx expo start" command in the terminal.
